# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-15)

**Core value:** GSD → Superpowers → Hookify 단계 전환을 자동화하여 학습 루프가 끊기지 않도록 한다
**Current focus:** Phase 2 — Manual Handoff & Status

## Current Position

Phase: 2 (Manual Handoff & Status) — EXECUTING
Plan: 2 of 2 (Plan 01 complete, Plan 02 pending)
Status: Executing Phase 2
Last activity: 2026-05-15 -- Phase 2 Plan 01 complete

Progress: [████░░░░░░] 38%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 3
- Average duration: ~6min
- Total execution time: ~18min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 | 2 | ~15min | ~7.5min |
| 2 | 1 | ~3min | ~3min |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (~5min), 01-02 (~10min), 02-01 (~3min)
- Trend: Schema-only plans are fast (~3min); upcoming 02-02 will be longer (two slash command authoring)

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Initialization: Non-invasive orchestrator — no fork of GSD/Superpowers/Hookify
- Initialization: Stop/SubagentStop hooks chosen as auto-handoff trigger
- Initialization: `.planning/HANDOFF.md` reused as state-tracking file (matches GSD convention)
- Initialization: Hookify auto-runs only after review (highest-signal moment)
- 01-01: author/owner are bare string `gyuha` (no email) per D-03/D-06
- 01-01: `repository` URL resolved from `git remote get-url origin` at execute time
- 01-01: marketplace.json `source: "."` — self-hosted same-repo registration
- 01-02: README install commands mirror manifest identity exactly — no improvisation, cross-file checked
- 01-02: Phase 1 README explicitly says no `/super-gsd:*` commands ship yet (anti-overselling, T-02-03)
- 01-02: ASCII workflow diagram chosen over Mermaid per D-11 (portable, identical render everywhere)
- 02-01: HANDOFF.md created with 5-column append-only schema, no data rows (D-26)
- 02-01: plugin.json patched via `jq` to change only `version` field (D-02, T-02-02 mitigation)
- 02-01: CHANGELOG [0.0.2] kept English (OSS surface, matches [0.0.1] tone) while SUMMARY in Korean per .planning/ policy
